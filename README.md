# Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Conductor

The Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Conductor is an innovative tool designed for musicians and music enthusiasts to explore new dimensions of creativity by generating random MIDI notes within selected key signatures. With its distinctive gyroscope and built-in sensors, it allows users to change notes, control expressions, and trigger sounds through physical movements and taps, making music creation more intuitive and engaging.

## How It Works

The Music Conductor utilizes a combination of a gyroscope and built-in sensors to facilitate dynamic musical interactions:

- **Gyroscope for Note Changes:** Change MIDI notes dynamically based on the orientation and movement of the device. Tilt, rotate, or move the controller to shift between notes and add expressive characteristics like vibrato or pitch bends.

- **Sensors for MIDI Triggers:** The built-in sensors detect taps and vibrations, acting as MIDI triggers. This feature is perfect for playing percussive notes, executing trills, or adding rhythmic elements to your performance. Tap on the device to play notes or create patterns, adding a tactile and immediate aspect to your music creation.

## Features

### Gyroscope Note Changing

- **Dynamic Note Variation:** Shift between notes in the selected scale through physical motion.
- **Expressive Control:** Enhance your musical expression with movement-based dynamics.
- **Physical Engagement:** Add a performative element to your compositions by physically interacting with the music.

### Sensor-based MIDI Trigger

- **Tap to Play:** Use the sensors to trigger notes or sounds by tapping on the device.
- **Sensitivity Adjustment:** Customize the sensitivity for different playing styles and environments.
- **Versatile Application:** Ideal for playing trills, percussive elements, or any musical pattern that benefits from a physical touch.
