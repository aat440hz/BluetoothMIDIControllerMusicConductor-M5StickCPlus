# Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Conductor

The Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Conductor is an innovative tool designed for musicians and music enthusiasts to explore new dimensions of creativity by generating random MIDI notes within selected key signatures. With its distinctive gyroscope and built-in sensors, it allows users to change notes and control expressions through physical movements and taps, making music creation more intuitive and engaging.

## How It Works

The Music Conductor utilizes a combination of a gyroscope and built-in sensors to facilitate dynamic musical interactions:

- **Gyroscope for Note Changes:** Change MIDI notes dynamically based on the orientation and movement of the device. Tilt, rotate, or move the controller to shift between notes, adding an expressive layer to your musical performance.

- **Sensors for MIDI Triggers:** The built-in sensors detect taps and vibrations, acting as MIDI triggers. This feature is perfect for playing percussive notes, executing trills, or adding rhythmic elements to your performance. Tap on the device to play notes or create patterns, adding a tactile and immediate aspect to your music creation.

## Features

### Gyroscope Note Changing

- **Dynamic Note Variation and Expressive Control:** Change between random notes in the selected scale through physical motion using the gyroscope to add an expressive quality to your music.
- **Physical Engagement:** Add a performative element to your compositions by physically interacting with the music.

### Sensor-based MIDI Trigger

- **Tap to Play:** Use the sensors to trigger notes or sounds by tapping on the device.
- **Sensitivity Adjustment:** Customize the sensitivity for different playing styles and environments.
- **Versatile Application:** Ideal for playing trills, percussive elements, or any musical pattern that benefits from a physical touch.

## Dependencies

To ensure smooth operation, you'll need:

1. **MIDIberry (Windows 10):** A MIDI loopback driver to route MIDI data between applications. [Download MIDIberry](http://newbodyfresher.linclip.com/).
2. **loopMIDI (Windows 10):** A tool for creating virtual MIDI ports, facilitating communication between MIDI applications. [Download loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html).

## Compatibility and Setup Instructions

The Bluetooth MIDI Controller Music Conductor has been confirmed to work well with various setups including Windows 10, Android, and now iPhone devices, providing a versatile tool for musicians and producers.

### For Windows 10 Users:
